# send_ascii_file_email

# This script sends an input text file (xmas card or ascii art picture) in several emails (one email per file line). 
#              The line is send as email subject, so it can be read without open the email. 
#              Take into account you cannot define subject email font type !  so no monospaced font can be used :(
